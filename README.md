# SETTLE

**SETTLE** is a cutting-edge mobile application designed to enhance the lives of residents in informal settlements by empowering each person to join or initiate community projects aimed at neighborhood improvement. One of the app's standout features is its innovative pathfinding algorithm, inspired by the efficiency of ant colonies, which identifies and suggests new pathways to enhance accessibility. By adding new paths to the existing network, SETTLE optimizes routes to reduce travel time between homes and key destinations, resulting in a more connected and navigable community. Each person can actively participate in or lead projects, making the neighborhood more livable, connected, and accessible for everyone.
